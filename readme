1.We have used 5 different models along with weighted average to generate final submission file.

2.The models used are :
  	Logistic regression(logistic_model.pckl)
  	Ridge(ridge_model.pckl)
  	Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD_model.pckl)
  	Random Forest(randomforest_model.pckl)
  	XGBoost(xgb_model.pckl)

3.To run the models on test data,run the 'start.py' script for all models and generate 5 different csv files.
  The required files can be found in python_script folder.
  
4.Then using 'blend.py' take weighted average.This will generate final csv file which can be evaluated for accuracy.

5.Pickle files-
